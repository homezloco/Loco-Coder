# Project Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the WindSurf AI Coding Platform backend.

## Functional Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- User registration and login
- Token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (admin, regular user)
- Password reset functionality
- Session management

### Project Management
- Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations for projects
- Project sharing and collaboration
- Project templates and scaffolding
- Project versioning and history

### Code Generation and Execution
- AI-powered code generation
- Code execution in isolated environments
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Real-time code execution feedback
- Code quality analysis

### File Management
- File system operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Directory structure management
- File import/export
- File type detection and syntax highlighting

### AI Integration
- Integration with Ollama for code generation
- Fallback mechanisms for AI service unavailability
- Context-aware code suggestions
- Natural language to code conversion

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time < 500ms for non-AI operations
- Scalable to handle concurrent users
- Efficient resource utilization

### Security
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Reliability
- High availability (99.9% uptime)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Data backup and recovery mechanisms

### Maintainability
- Well-documented code and APIs
- Modular architecture
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Consistent coding standards

## Constraints
- Must run on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Must support offline operation
- Must have fallbacks for all external services
- Must be containerizable with Docker

## Acceptance Criteria
Each feature should include specific acceptance criteria that define when the requirement is considered met.
