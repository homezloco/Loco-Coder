# Implementation Plan: Multi-Language Support

This implementation plan outlines the steps needed to expand our local AI-powered coding platform to support additional programming languages, including both backend languages and mobile development frameworks.

## 1. Overview

Our platform will be enhanced to support the following languages:

### Backend Languages
1. **Go**
   - Compiled to a single binary with minimal runtime dependencies
   - Goroutines for lightweight concurrency
   - Excellent performance for networked services

2. **Rust**
   - Memory- and thread-safe by design (no garbage collector)
   - Blazing performance, zero-cost abstractions
   - Growing support for both web and back-end

### Mobile App Development
1. **Swift (iOS)**
   - Modern syntax, memory safety, powerful type system
   - First-party support from Apple (SwiftUI, Combine)
   - Native iOS apps (iPhone, iPad, watchOS, tvOS)

2. **Kotlin (Android)**
   - Concise, null-safe, interoperable with Java
   - Official Android language with coroutines for async
   - Native Android apps and shared business logic

3. **Dart (Flutter)**
   - Single codebase compiles to both iOS and Android
   - Widget-driven UI, highly customizable and performant
   - Cross-platform mobile apps with native-level performance

4. **JavaScript / TypeScript (React Native)**
   - Leverage web skills for mobile UI
   - Large ecosystem of community modules
   - Cross-platform apps when already using React on web

5. **C# (Xamarin / MAUI)**
   - Single .NET codebase for iOS, Android, Windows
   - Full access to native APIs
   - Enterprise apps targeting multiple platforms

## 2. Implementation Approach

### 2.1 Backend Code Execution Support

We'll extend the `CodeExecutor` class in `backend/code_execution.py` to support Go and Rust:

```python
def execute_code(self, code: str, language: str = "python") -> CodeExecutionResult:
    """
    Execute code with appropriate runner based on language
    with multiple fallback mechanisms
    """
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Choose execution method based on language
    if language.lower() == "python":
        return self._execute_python(code)
    elif language.lower() in ["javascript", "js"]:
        return self._execute_javascript(code)
    elif language.lower() == "go":
        return self._execute_go(code)
    elif language.lower() == "rust":
        return self._execute_rust(code)
    else:
        # Default fallback for unsupported languages
        return CodeExecutionResult(
            error=f"Unsupported language: {language}. Currently supported: python, javascript, go, rust",
            success=False,
            execution_time=time.time() - start_time,
            method_used="none"
        )
```

### 2.2 Monaco Editor Integration

Extend `MonacoConfig.jsx` to add snippets and auto-completion for all new languages:

```javascript
// Go snippets
monaco.languages.registerCompletionItemProvider('go', {
  provideCompletionItems: () => {
    const suggestions = [
      {
        label: 'func',
        kind: monaco.languages.CompletionItemKind.Snippet,
        insertText: [
          'func ${1:functionName}(${2:params}) {',
          '\t${3:// Function body}',
          '}'
        ].join('\n'),
        insertTextRules: monaco.languages.CompletionItemInsertTextRule.InsertAsSnippet,
        documentation: 'Create a function'
      },
      // Additional Go snippets
    ];
    return { suggestions };
  }
});

// Similar configurations for Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Dart, and C#
```
